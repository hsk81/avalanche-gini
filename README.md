# Stake Distribution of Avalanche Validators

![](./image/2021-06-30.svg)

The graph above shows the *cumulative stake distribution* among the Avalanche validators: Since (at the moment), there is no progressive taxation on the larger validator *rewards*, the shown GINI inequality coefficient is applicable to wealth (i.e. stake) *and* income (i.e. rewards):

1. The *red* line plots the cumulative stake of validators including delegations. The shown GINI coefficient is applicable to this plot of total weights only.

2. The *blue* line plots the cumulative stake of validators excluding delegations, where its GINI coefficient is not shown, but it is obviously in the same ball park as for the *red* one.

3. The diagonal *dotted* line is the "frontier of decentralization", i.e. if all stakes were distributed equally among all the validators, then the *red* and *blue* lines would overlap with this *dotted* diagonal.

4. And finally, the vertical *dashed-dotted* one is the "line of control" at the `30%` -vs- `70%` split (w.r.t. total stakes): Hence, the *many* smaller validators on the *left hand side* of the line control only `30%` of all stakes, while the *few* larger validators on the *right hand side* control a whopping `70%`!


### GINI and Wealth

Despite having such an extreme wealth GINI, Avalanche suprisingly seems to feature *less wealth inequality* than the [global][gini-wealth] average of `88.5%` (in 2019) and about the *same* as for the [United States][gini-wealth] of `85.2%` (also in 2019). Although extreme, these two comparisons are perhaps an indication, that there should not be a *wealth tax* (i.e. partial confiscation and redistribution) on the existing larger validator stakes.

### GINI and Income

However, if we compare the same GINI in terms of *rewards* (on the stakes), then it is obvious that Avalanche displays __significantly__ *more income inequality* than the [global][gini-income] average of `38%` (in 2002) and also *more* than the [United States][gini-income] of `47%` (in 2014). This gap is a clear indication, that the Avalanche validator community should introduce *progressive taxation* on the larger validator *rewards* (but not stakes), and then redistribute the collected tax among the smaller ones.
